# FusionCharts_Multiaxis_PHP_MySQL
PHP Script to create FusionCharts Multi-Axis Code from MySQL data

I created this script to create the FusionCharts data to graph temperature and humidity gathered from IoT sensors which is stored in a MySQL database.  It includes URL variables for time ("duration") and sensor name ("location").
